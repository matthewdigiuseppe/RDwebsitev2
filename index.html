              <div class="about-text">
                  <p>REALdegrees was founded by educators and administrators concerned with the impact of AI on academic integrity and assessment. As AI tools become more sophisticated, traditional assessment methods are increasingly vulnerable to misuse, threatening the validity and value of education.</p>
                  <p>Our mission is to preserve the human element in education while embracing the potential of technology. We work with educational institutions to develop innovative approaches that maintain academic rigor and integrity in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
                  <p><strong>Our main goal is to create "a common benchmark" so students, parents, employers and educators can accurately assess the true value of a college degree.</strong> This benchmark provides clarity and confidence in an era where AI technologies have raised questions about educational authenticity.</p>
                  <p>Our team combines expertise in education, assessment design, technology, and policy development to create holistic solutions that address the AI crisis in education head-on.</p>

              <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
              <p>The core values that guide our approach to education in the age of AI</p>
          </div>
          <div class="philosophy-content">
              <div class="philosophy-section">
                  <h3>Our Core Belief</h3>
                  <p>We believe that education is not just a pathway to knowledge but the foundational process through which individuals develop genuine human potential. This development—encompassing critical thinking, problem solving, and ethical judgment—is the true “human capital” that propels innovation and societal progress. Moreover, we recognize that education requires extrinsic motivation: external incentives, rewards, and societal recognition are vital in driving achievement and reinforcing the signals that attest to a learner’s effort and capabilities.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="philosophy-section">
                  <h3>The Dual Threat of AI in Education</h3>
                  <h4>Undermining Human Capital</h4>
                  <p>From a human capital perspective, education is an investment in real, cultivated skills and abilities. An over-reliance on AI tools risks creating shortcuts in learning, where students might bypass the rigorous intellectual engagement that transforms raw information into lifelong competencies. This erosion diminishes the authentic growth of individuals and ultimately undercuts economic and social advancement.</p>
                  <h4>Diluting Educational Signals</h4>
                  <p>Educational achievements serve as markers to employers and society of an individual’s capabilities—attributes such as diligence, resilience, and problem-solving acumen. If AI becomes a crutch that inflates grades or generates assignments, the credibility of these signals is compromised. This not only erodes trust in educational credentials but also challenges the labor market’s ability to discern genuine merit.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="philosophy-section">
                  <h3>Our Mission and Approach</h3>
                  <p>Our nonprofit is dedicated to the rigorous assessment of AI’s role in education. We aim to ensure that emerging technologies are implemented in ways that:</p>
                  <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
                      <li><strong>Enhance, Not Replace, Learning:</strong> Advocate for AI tools that support and deepen understanding, rather than serve as substitutes for genuine intellectual engagement.</li>
                      <li><strong>Preserve the Integrity of Educational Credentials:</strong> Support policies and frameworks that maintain the authenticity of educational signals, ensuring that credentials continue to reflect true human capital.</li>
                      <li><strong>Reinforce Extrinsic Motivation:</strong> Uphold the value of external incentives and rewards, ensuring that the motivational structures which drive achievement and excellence remain intact.</li>
                      <li><strong>Inform Policy and Practice:</strong> Conduct independent, evidence-based research to guide educators, policymakers, and stakeholders in ethically integrating AI into the educational landscape.</li>
                      <li><strong>Champion Lifelong Learning:</strong> Foster an environment where continuous human skill development is prioritized over transient technological gains.</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="philosophy-section">
                  <h3>Our Vision for the Future</h3>
                  <p>We envision an education system where AI is harnessed responsibly—augmenting human insight without diluting the hard-earned signals of academic and personal growth. By safeguarding both the process of genuine learning and the extrinsic rewards that inspire it, we support a future where every individual’s educational journey truly reflects their unique potential, ensuring that society benefits from a workforce that is both skilled and authentically credentialed.</p>
